## Introduction

Attrahunt is a multinational pharmaceutical company with around a thousand employees. In recent years, Attrahunt has upgraded most of its HR activities to become more professional.
 
Attrahunt’s recruitment manager has requested that you build an operational dashboard which allows them to optimize their performance. The company wants to have an operational overview of the cost, time efficiency, and effectiveness of different sourcing channels so it can hire faster and cheaper without decreasing quality. 

## Data 

This dashboard will be based on database extracts from the company’s applicant tracking system (ATS). 

Attrahunt’s IT team has provided database access to connect to the relevant data tables.

The dashboard contains created DAX measures to formulate a recruitment funnel to track applications from stage-to-stage of the recruitment process, as well as measures to drill into how many workdays are spent in each stage of the process. There are also measures established for offer acceptance rate, time-to-fill, and time-to-hire.
